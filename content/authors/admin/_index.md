Bella is trying her best as an aspiring Data Scientist. She has bagged degrees in Human Biology, Health Promotion and Nutrition, and is working towards bagging another in Digital Health (you guessed it right, it's the intersection between health and technology). Her current struggle is finding a thesis topic that will not only showcase her skills for research in healthcare tech/informatics but also better humans by improving their quality of life. Outside of studies/work, she is traveling, discovering cultures, learning about history, and building healthy friendships through trust, curiosity, and play; or she is simply on the internet probably checking new techs. When this internet thing goes out of style, she will certainly retire to a deserted island, someplace with white sand beaches and blue waters.
